This file contains the function that sends a transcript from a
YT video to the gpt3 API and returns a summary of the transcript.

Key Facts:
    - The language model used in openai's backend is davinci-003.

    This function sends a transcript from a YT video to
    the gpt3 API and returns a summary of the transcript.

    Args:
        yt_transcript (string): The transcript from the YT video.

        temperature (float): A decimal value between 0 and 1. This is
                    controls the randomness of the generated text. A
                    value of 0 makes the engine deterministic, which
                    means that it will always generate the same output
                    for a given input text.

        max_tokens (int): The maximum number of tokens used.

        top_p (float): An alternative to sampling with temperature, called
                       nucleus sampling, where the model considers the
                       results of the tokens with top_p probability mass.
                       So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10%
                       probability mass are considered.

        presence_penalty (float): Presence penalty does not consider how
                                  frequently a word has been used,
                                  but just if the word exists in the text.
                                  The difference between these two options
                                  is subtle, but you can think of Frequency
                                  Penalty as a way to prevent word
                                  repetitions, and Presence Penalty as a way to
                                  prevent topic repetitions.

    Returns:
        string: The summary of the transcript of the a given YT video.
